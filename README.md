# Haole

Haole is a repository that, through GitHub Actions, saves daily surf forecasts for future reference. 🏄‍♂️

## Motivation

I love surfing, but I struggle to find the best conditions for my local beaches. Surf forecasts are often inaccurate or incomplete, and word of mouth is unreliable. I created this repository to track the daily surf forecast and compare it with my own observations. This way, I can learn from the past and plan for the future. I hope this project can help me and other surfers find the perfect waves. 🌊

## Features

Haole uses GitHub Actions to fetch the daily surf forecast from [Surfguru](https://surfguru.com.br) and save a local copy to make it accessible in the future. Forecasts contain information such as:

- The date and time of the forecast
- The location and name of the beach (or town)
- The wave height, period, and direction
- The wind speed, direction, and gust
- The air and water temperature
- The tide, sunrise, and sunset

You can use this information to plan your surfing sessions, compare different beaches, and learn from past conditions.

## Installation and usage

To use Haole, you don’t need to install anything. You just need to have access to this repository. You can browse the folders and view the surf forecast web pages. You can also read the REPORT.md file (if there is one) to see the notes and feedback from the surfing session that day. 🏄‍♂️🌊📝


## Contributing 

If you want to write a "beach report" based on your surfing experience:

1. Clone this repository
2. Write a markdown file named `$BEACH_report.md` where `$BEACH` is the name of where you surfed. You can include information such as:
    - The date and time of your surfing session
    - The location and name of the beach
    - The wave quality and difficulty
    - The crowd and vibe
    - The equipment and gear you used
    - The tips and tricks you learned
    - The photos and videos you captured
3. Commit your changes and send a pull request!

Haole is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested in surfing and data. If you want to contribute, you can:
